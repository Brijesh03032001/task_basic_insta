# Basic Instagram App
A basic insta app which is  basically a task given to me by the appointy. 
In this I am creating a new user , getting a user through id ,create a post ,getting a post using id and list all posts of a user .


I am using "structure" data type to store the user and post information .

USER Structure:
Users should have the following attributes:-
* Id
* Name
* Email
* Password


POST Structure:
Posts should have the following Attributes:- 
* Id
* Caption
* Image URL
* Posted Timestamp

These all structures are stored into the users and posts structure array and then i use the *For Loop* to match which all posts are related to the specific user and hence 
I am able to list down all the posts for the particular user.
